NAME
    Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS - Fast XS inherited accessors

SYNOPSIS
      #install accessors at compile time
      use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS 
          inherited => [qw/foo bar/], # here key names are equal to accessor names
      ;
  
      use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS { # optional braces
          inherited => {
            bar => 'bar_key',
            foo => 'foo_key',
          },
      };
  
      #or in the Class::Accessor::Grouped-like fashion
      use parent 'Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS';
      __PACKAGE__->mk_inherited_accessors('foo', ['bar', 'bar_key']);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a very fast implementation for 'inherited'
    accessors, that were introduced by the Class::Accessor::Grouped module.
    They give you a capability to override values set in a parent class with
    values set in childs or object instances. Generated accessors are
    compatible with Class::Accessor::Grouped generated ones.

    Since this module focuses primary on speed, it provides no capability to
    have your own per-class getters/setters logic (like overriding
    get_inherited/set_inherited in Class::Accessor::Grouped), but it gives
    you an ability to register a single get/set callback for you own
    accessor types.

UTF-8
    Starting with the perl 5.16.0, this module provides full support for
    UTF-8 method names and hash keys. Before that, you can't distinguish
    UTF-8 strings from bytes string in method names, only in hash keys. You
    have been warned.

THREADS
    Though highly discouraged, perl threads are supported by
    Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS. You may have accessors with same names
    pointing to different keys in different threads, etc. There are no known
    conceptual leaks.

PERFORMANCE
    Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS is at least 10x times faster than
    Class::Accessor::Grouped, depending on your usage pattern. Accessing
    data from a parent in a large inheritance chain is still the worst case,
    but even there Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS beats
    Class::Accessor::Grouped best-case.

    You can see some benchmarks by running bench/bench.pl

EXTENDING
        package MyAccessor;
        # 'register_type' isn't exported
        Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS::register_type(
            inherited_cb => {on_read => sub {}, on_write => sub{}},
        );

        package MyClass;
        use MyAccessor;
        use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS {
            inherited    => ['foo'],
            inherited_cb => ['bar'],
        };

    You can register new inherited accessor types with associated read/write
    callbacks. They're still 'inherited', but you can modify return values.
    Those new types can be installed using the
    Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS import() call. Unlike
    Class::Accessor::Grouped, here's a single callback per accessor type,
    without any inheritance lookups for get_*/set_* functions.

    on_read callback gets a single argument - from a normal 'inherited'
    accessor. It's return value is a new accessor's return value (and is not
    stored anywhere).

    on_write callback gets two arguments - original args from the accessor
    call. It's return value is saved instead of the user's supplied one.

PROFILING WITH Devel::NYTProf
    To perform it's task, Devel::NYTProf hooks into the perl interpreter by
    replacing default behaviour for calling subroutines on the opcode level.
    To squeeze last bits of performance, Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS does
    the same, but separately on each call site of its accessors. It turns
    out into CAIX favor - Devel::NYTProf sees only first call to CAIX
    accessor, but all subsequent ones become invisible to the subs profiler.

    Note that statement profiler still correctly accounts time spent on a
    line, you just don't see time spent in accessors' calls separately.
    That's sometimes OK, sometimes not - you get profile with all possible
    optimizations on, but it's hard for understanding.

    Since it's hard to detect Devel::NYTProf (and any other module doing
    such magic) in a portable way (all hail Win32), there's an %ENV switch
    available - you can set CAIXS_DISABLE_ENTERSUB to a true value to
    disable call site optimization and get full subs profile.
